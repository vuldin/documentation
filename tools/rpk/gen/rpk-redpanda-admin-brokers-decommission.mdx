title: rpk redpanda admin brokers decommission
rpk_version: (rev )
---

Decommission the given broker.

Decommissioning a broker removes it from the cluster.

A decommission request is sent to every broker in the cluster, only the cluster
leader handles the request.

For safety on v22.x clusters, this command will not run if the requested
broker is in maintenance mode. As of v23.x, Redpanda supports
decommissioning a node that is currently in maintenance mode. If you are on
a v22.x cluster and need to bypass the maintenance mode check (perhaps your
cluster is unreachable), use the hidden --force flag.

## Usage

```bash
rpk redpanda admin brokers decommission [BROKER ID] [flags]
```
